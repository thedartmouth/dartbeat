Stable tag: 0.9.7.5

Formats all content images on a page / post giving them borders and captions.

== Description ==

Image Formatr is a simple plugin that goes through all the content
images on a post/page:

  1. gives them a standardized thumbnail format using CSS
  2. puts a caption underneath each one using the title
  3. makes them linked so they popup in full size

Thumbnails are not generated, the actual image is displayed in a smaller
size by telling the browser the preferred display dimensions.

*Note: **Flickr** support is slated for the next release, version 0.9.8.*

I would love your feedback!

thanks.

= Usage =

*This only applies to the images you put in your content, not theme graphics.*

    <img
      src="/images/picture.jpg"
      class="alignright"
      title="A sample caption"
      link="http://example.com/"
      hint="Image borrowed from example.com"
    />

After the plugin runs, the output to the browser looks like:

    <div class="img alignright" style="width: 140px;">
    <a
      href="/images/picture.jpg"
      class="highslide"
      onclick="return hs.expand(this, { slideshowGroup: 'main' })"
    ><img
      src="/images/picture.jpg"
      title="Image borrowed from example.com" alt=""
      width="140" height="90"
    ></a>
    <div style="width: 100%;">
      <a href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">A sample caption</a>
    </div>
    </div>

&nbsp;

= Requirements =

No external requirements are needed.  The Highslide JavaScript library is
now packaged in the Image-formatr plugin itself.  The Highslide Integration
plugin used in previous versions of Image-formatr is no longer needed.

= Features =

  * Generates image captions using the image `title` or `alt`
  * Shows all content images on the blog as small thumbnails
  (does not create new thumbnail images)
  * Standardizes all thumbnails with zero post changes
  * Allows for fine-grained control of each image's format
  * Zooms image to large size when clicked using the
  [Highslide](http://highslide.com/) library
  * Outputs standard XHTML compliant markup
  * Support BBCode [img] shortcodes

== Overrides ==

The actions of the plugin are enabled and disabled with administration settings
but can be overridden on each individual image.

  * **`usemysize`** - true/false - *true = do not ignore an image width and height*
  * **`usemya`**    - true/false - *true = do not ignore a parent anchor tag*
  * **`nocap`**     - true/false - *true = do not create a caption*
  * **`nofx`**      - true/false - *true = no popup effect*
  * **`link`**      - string url - *make the caption a link to the url*
  * **`hint`**      - string txt - *this will be the new image title*
  * **`asis`**      - true/false - *true = don't change nuthin*
  * **`group`**     - string txt - *separate popup slideshows*
  * **`thumb`**     - string url - *image thumbnail* (version 0.9.7)
  * **`page`**      - single/!single/front/!front - *page filtering* (version 0.9.7)

If you want to surround an image with an anchor tag `<a>`, then you should add
a `usemya` attribute within the image tag or else your anchor will be ignored
and replaced.  If you do not want the popup effect at all, add a `nofx` attribute
to the image.  If you do not want any caption, you can specify `nocap`, or just
leave the title blank. And to have the plugin completely ignore an image and
output the content directly from the post, use the `asis` attribute.

**Example**

    <a href="http://www.example.com/">
    <img
      src="/images/picture.jpg"
      title="Click to visit website"
      nocap="true"
      usemya="true"
    /></a>

Note: concerning the *true/false* overrides, do not include "false" parameters
like `<img usemya="false">`, for these boolean overrides only include the attribute
if you want to designate a "true" value.

== Installation ==

*Note: versions 0.9.4/5/6 do not preserve the plugin options after deactivation.
Therefore, if you are upgrading from one of these versions then write down your
Image Formatr settings before you upgrade, log in to the Wordpress adminstration
(wp-admin), go to **Settings** and then **Image Formatr**.*

  1. Download and extract the plugin to your computer
  1. Extract the files keeping the directory structure in tact
  1. Upload the extracted directory (image-formatr) to your WordPress plugin
  directory (wp-content/plugins)
  1. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress admin

More information, including how to contact me, is available at

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. *Wordpress "smiley" emoticons like `:)` keep showing up with the other
images.  How can I prevent smileys from being effected?*

Version 0.9.6 includes a *class exclusion list* which prevents an image
from being processed by the plugin if it contains a CSS class that is in
the list.  Wordpress uses "wp-smiley" for their smileys so enter `wp-smiley`
into the exclusion classes in the Wordpress administration settings for
Image-formatr then click "Update Options".

2. *These image attributes (e.g. page, nocap, link, etc) are not XHTML
standard attributes.  Why do you use them?*

The Image Formatr *override* attributes do not get written to the browser.
They are only used by the plugin for format configuration of individual
images.  Unless you specify the `asis` attribute, all images in your content
are deconstructed then rebuilt sending only XHTML compliant markup to the
client.

3. *Is it possible to change the caption background color?*

Edit the file `image-formatr.css` around line 27 change:

    div.img div {
      background-color: auto;

to:

    div.img div {
      background-color: purple;

You can also add the following html anywhere in your theme output:

    <style>
        div.img div { background-color: purple }
    </style>

== To Do List ==

* add screenshot of output image with caption

== Current Wishlist for version 1.0 ==

* admin option to move title to alt, should it overwrite an existing alt?
* phone-home feature, activate/deactivate stats helper with version number
* support the custom CSS class for div image container
* add admin option to configure the plugin priority
* add admin option for html/xhtml &lt;img/&gt; closing tags
* add admin option for moving title attribute to alt attribute
* add admin option for name to use for default highslide slideshow group
* debug mode could show images not found and whatnots and profiling stats
* change [flickrset id="1234"] to [flickr set="1234"]
* change [flickr pid="123"] to [flickr img="123"]
* add a do_shortcode() list for before/after IF content filtering
    add_filter('the_content', 'do_shortcode', $custom_shortcode_priority, $arguments)
    do_shortcode('[ngggallery]');
    do_shortcode('[flickr]');
* show "the_content" ordering vis a vie wp-hooks-filters-flow.php
    Priority 8 :
        WP_Embed-&gt;run_shortcode()
        WP_Embed-&gt;autoembed()
    Priority 10 :
        wptexturize()
        convert_smilies()
        convert_chars()
        wpautop()
        shortcode_unautop()
        prepend_attachment()
    Priority 11 :
        capital_P_dangit()
        do_shortcode()
    Priority 20 :
        ImageFormatr-&gt;filter()

== Current Buglist ==

* bug: if you click too early, before the highslide loads, the anchor
    is still "live" and will not use ajax, i.e the new url will load
    which is the normal anchor behaviour
* bug: add_settings_field() &lt;label for="s"&gt; not &lt;label for="stdthumb"&gt;
    work-around is to only use unique single char id fields
    defined as constants
* bug: zoomin.cur is often, but not always, 404'd
