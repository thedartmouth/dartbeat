Allows you to add an author name and link to the byline, other than the actual logged in user, without that custom author having to have a WordPress account.

== Description ==

Lots of folks using WordPress sites with multiple authors may run into this problem.  You want to attribute correct credit to the writer/author of the article, but not give out access to your WordPress install.  Maybe because it's a one-time article, maybe not, who cares?  

If the author of your blog entry is different than your logged in user and you don't want to have to create a separate user account, just add the name as you'd like it to appear to the Custom Author Byline panel below the post/page editor (custom post types can be added too).  Easy!

For more information on the WordPress <a href="http://seoserpent.com/wordpress/custom-author-byline">Custom Author Byline</a> plugin and how to use it, visit the information page at the preceding link.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded plugin file `custom-author-byline.zip`,
2. Upload `custom-author-byline.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
3. Activate the plugin "Custom Author Byline" through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. That's it!  You will now see a new panel below your post/page editor where you can type in whatever name and link you want to appear in place of your logged in user.
