This widget makes it possible for you to fully customize a Tag Cloud ( or multiple Tag Clouds ) to meet your specific needs.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to `Appearance->Widgets` and add the widget.

***Special instructions for Multisite Blog Farms:** If you're installing this plugin on WordPress® with Multisite/Networking enabled, and you run a Blog Farm ( i.e. you give away free blogs to the public ); please `define("MULTISITE_FARM", true);` in your /wp-config.php file. When this plugin is running on a Multisite Blog Farm, it will mutate itself ( including its menus ) for safe compatiblity with Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a Blog Farm. If you're running the standard version of WordPress®, or you run WordPress® Multisite to host your own sites, you can ( and should ) skip this step.*

== Description ==

The Super Tags plugin, is a customizable alternative to the default WordPress® Tag Cloud widget. This widget makes it possible for you to fully customize a Tag Cloud ( or multiple Tag Clouds ) to meet your specific needs. It takes the same options as the `wp_tag_cloud()` function. You can specify a number of configurable parameters, such as: minimum font size, maximum font size, maximum tags to display, format ( `flat|list` ), separators, order, sort method, specific tags to include, specific tags to exclude, or even a specific taxonomy ( `post_tag|category|link_category` ).
