Track Twitter search results, a Twitter hashtag, or a Twitter profile using sidebar widgets.

== Description ==

**This plugin requires PHP5 (see Other Notes > PHP4 for more).**

A widget, Twitter Search Tracker, which allows you to specify and display a [Twitter search](http://search.twitter.com/) (or a Twitter hashtag) in your sidebar. Twitter searches are [very flexible](http://search.twitter.com/operators), and you can display anything from Hashtags to individual, or aggregated Twitter streams.

Another widget, Twitter Profile Tracker, allows you to show the tweets from a specific user in your sidebar.

== Other notes ==

The plugin puts "Twitter Tracker" fields in the post and page screens, you can enter a specific query into this metabox and this will override the query entered on the widget editor... this means you can have individual Twitter search queries in the widget for each of your posts and pages. If you enter nothing in those fields then the widget will use the Twitter search query on the widget editor screen. (Developers, you can add this metabox to custom post types although you will need to use the tt_allowed_post_types filter to get the metabox fields to save... check out the code.)

The HTML output is fairly well classed, but if you need to adapt it you can. Create a directory in your *theme* called "view", and a directory within that one called "category-images-ii". Then copy the template files `view/twitter-tracker/widget-content.php` and `view/twitter-tracker/widget-error.php` from the plugin directory into your theme directory and amend as you need. If these files exist in these directories in your theme they will override the ones in the plugin directory. This is good because it means that when you update the plugin you can simply overwrite the old plugin directory as you haven't changed any files in it. All hail [John Godley](http://urbangiraffe.com/) for the code which allows this magic to happen.

== PHP4 ==

Many of my plugin now require at least PHP5. I know that WordPress officially supports PHP4, but I don't. PHP4 is a mess and makes coding a lot less efficient, and when you're releasing stuff for free these things matter. PHP5 has been out for several years now and is fully production ready, as well as being naturally more secure and performant.

If you're still running PHP4, I strongly suggest you talk to your hosting company about upgrading your servers. All reputable hosting companies should offer PHP5 as well as PHP4.

Right, that's it. Grump over. ;)
